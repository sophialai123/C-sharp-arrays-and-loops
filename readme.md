## Building Arrays
Similar to defining a variable for one piece of data, when we define a variable to hold an array we also have to specify the type:

```
// These arrays store ints, strings, and doubles, respectively
int[] x; 
string[] s; 
double[] d; 

```

To declare a variable that holds an array, we first write the type of data that will be stored in an array, then add the square brackets `[]` to signify that it is holding an array (rather than a single value), followed by the name of the array.

Like a variable, we can define and initialize an array at the same time, by specifying the values we want to store in it:

`int[] plantHeights = { 3, 4, 6 };`
